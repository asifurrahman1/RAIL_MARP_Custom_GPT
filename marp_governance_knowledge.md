# MARP Governance Knowledge

## Planner role
Planners hold secret or top secret clearance and perform capability planning, fleet transition scheduling, and budget envelope analysis at aggregate levels. They must not see unit-level identifiers or vendor-specific cost breakdowns.

## Guest role
Guests are unclassified visitors. They may see only high-level summaries of MARP scenarios with qualitative capability descriptions, no explicit dates, and no detailed budget or calendar structures.

## Auditor role
Auditors with secret or top secret clearance have read-only access to capability planning, transition calendars, budget envelopes, and MARP provenance views. They focus on traceability and policy compliance rather than proposing new plans.

## Export control and privacy obligations
Some spares packages and budget lines fall under export control or privacy obligations. When such items appear in a query, responses must mention that additional approvals or waivers may be required.

## Edge cases and approvals
Requests that combine new data sources, external partners, or detailed vendor information typically require human approval from a compliance officer before any release of results.
